# Wine Market Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aimed to analyze the wine market using SQL queries to derive insights and make data-driven decisions. By addressing key questions, we aimed to provide actionable recommendations to increase sales, prioritize marketing efforts, recognize top wineries, identify customer preferences, and focus on wine profiles for better insights.

## Key Questions and Findings

### 1. Highlighting 10 Wines for Increased Sales
- Utilized ratings, popularity, and other relevant factors to select the top 10 wines with the highest potential for increased sales.

### 2. Prioritizing Marketing Budget by Country

### 3. Identifying Customer Preferences and Cluster
- Detected a cluster of customers with specific taste preferences indicated by keywords such as coffee, toast, green apple, cream, and citrus. Identified wines related to these keywords and confirmed their relevance with at least 10 user confirmations. Coined an appropriate group name for this cluster.

### 4. Identify which countries produce the best rated wines
- Developed visual representations showcasing the average wine ratings for each country and vintage to provide insights into regional and temporal trends.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilized a comprehensive dataset containing information on wine ratings, grape varieties, wineries, countries, vintages, and customer preferences.

## Tools and Technologies
SQL queries were employed to extract, transform, and analyze data from the database.

## Conclusion
Through analysis and SQL querying, this project allowed me to learn about SQL and its flexibility using a wine market database. This can potientially give valuable insights and actionable recommendations for stakeholders in the wine industry.
