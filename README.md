# Wine Market Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aimed to analyze the wine market using SQL queries to derive meaningful insights. The aim was to provide actionable recommendations to increase sales, prioritize marketing efforts, recognize top wineries, identify customer preferences and focus on visualizing wine profiles for better insights.

The notebook will show you the analysis pipeline.

## Key Questions and Findings

### 1. Highlighting 10 Wines for Increased Sales
- Utilized ratings, popularity, and other relevant factors to select the top 10 wines with the highest potential for increased sales.

### 2. Prioritizing Marketing Budget by Country
- Analyzed market potential, consumer behavior, and other factors to recommend the most lucrative country for marketing efforts within the given budget constraints.

### 3. Identifying Customer Preferences and Cluster
- Detected a cluster of customers with specific taste preferences indicated by keywords such as coffee, toast, green apple, cream, and citrus. Identified wines related to these keywords and confirmed their relevance with at least 10 user confirmations. Coined an appropriate group name for this cluster.

### 4. Identify which countries produce the best rated wines
- Developed visual representations showcasing the average wine ratings for each country and vintage to provide insights into regional and temporal trends.
